This project is a Django-based travel booking platform.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

âœ… Now you have **models, serializers, a seeder, and project documentation** ready.  

Would you like me to also add **ViewSets + URLs** so you can expose Listings and Bookings via API immediately?
